Steps to Run the Node.js Application Locally:

Clone the generated repository from your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install Dependencies:

Install the Node.js dependencies using npm or yarn.
npm install
# or
yarn install
Set Environment Variables:

Create a .env file at the root of your project and configure your environment variables as needed. Below is an example for MongoDB and JWT:
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/my-db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
Create MongoDB Database:

Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine.
Create a database if it doesn't exist (the application can also create it dynamically on the first run).
# Start MongoDB service
sudo systemctl start mongod
Run the Application:

Start the application using npm or yarn.
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
Steps Recap:
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install dependencies:

npm install
Configure environment variables: Create a .env file with necessary configurations.

Ensure MongoDB is running: Start MongoDB service or use a connection string that matches your environment.

Run the application:

npm run start:dev
Example of .env File:
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/my-db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
Access the Application:
Once the application is running, it should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 or any other port you have configured.
